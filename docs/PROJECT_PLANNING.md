# Vyamir | Project Planning & Strategic Roadmap
**Phase Identification:** Alpha-to-Gold Deployment (V3-Production)

---

## 1. Project Vision
To create the world's most immersive, data-driven atmospheric cockpit. Vyamir aims to bridge the gap between complex meteorological science and premium cinematic user experiences.

## 2. Objective Key Results (OKRs)

### Objective 1: Operational Stability & Deployment
*   **KR 1:** Transition from Flask development server to **Gunicorn** for production WSGI orchestration.
*   **KR 2:** Secure 100% Google AdSense compliance via root-level routing of `ads.txt`.
*   **KR 3:** Deploy a unified **Procfile** for zero-config Render orchestration.

### Objective 2: High-Fidelity UX & Mobile Sync
*   **KR 1:** Harden the **Zero-Drift UI** to eliminate horizontal wiggle on 100% of mobile devices.
*   **KR 2:** Implement the **7-Day Precision Forecast** with synchronized 7-day navigation.
*   **KR 3:** Relocate the tactical radar to the baseline for optimal data hierarchy.

### Objective 3: Performance Excellence
*   **KR 1:** Maintain sub-2 second dashboard hydration via Parallel ThreadPool execution.
*   **KR 2:** Optimize static asset delivery by centralizing compliance manifests in the `/static` high-fidelity node.

## 3. Resource Allocation (V3 Status)

| Stream | Focus |
| :--- | :--- |
| **DevOps** | Render Deployment, Gunicorn Config, Procfile. |
| **Compliance** | Static routing for Ads.txt, Robots, Sitemap. |
| **UX Hardening** | Zero-Drift CSS, 7-Day Forecast sync, Radar relocation. |

## 4. Milestone Timeline (Actualized)

*   **Phase I-III:** Core Engine, Zenith UI, and Performance Optimization.
*   **Phase IV (Production Readiness):** Gunicorn integration, Root-level compliance routing, Map relocation, and total Mobile Stabilization.
