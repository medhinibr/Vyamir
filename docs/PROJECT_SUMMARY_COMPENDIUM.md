*   **Compliance Protocol:** Specialized Flask routing engine that serves `ads.txt`, `robots.txt`, and `sitemap.xml` directly from the `/static` high-fidelity node at the root level.
*   **Temporal Calibration:** Proprietary "Time-Slip" sync that aligns hourly data with the target city's exact local time.
*   **Zero-Drift UI:** A robust CSS architecture that eliminates horizontal drifting on flagship mobile devices.

## 3. High-Fidelity Features
*   **Precision Dashboard:** 7-Day trend analysis synchronized with Open-Meteo satellite vectors.
*   **Atmospheric Visuals:** Dynamic condition-mapped video loops and colorful OSM natural-horizon mapping.
*   **Tactical Radar:** Relocated to the baseline for optimal data visualization hierarchy.
*   **SkyID Economy:** Decentralized point system with ACID-compliant P2P transfers.

## 4. Deployment Specifications
*   **Environment:** Python 3.9+ / Gunicorn / Render Cloud.
